####    Today's Progress:
-   Create a mini project to help me learn more about SARS-CoV-2 virus.   
-   Learned how to download nucleic acid sequence from NCBI with EDirect tool, an method to search for a accession number and download the seuqence on the Bash terminal window. Notably, the 'nuccore' and 'nucleotide' database are the same.
-   Try to use `ncbi-genome-download` script. I accidently downloaded all of viral genomes in the NCBI database.
-   Read a article about GC content of virus genome. The GC content of genome can vary widely in organisms. So, I might need to look into coding sequences to find out why SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than other coronaviruses.
-   SARS-CoV-2 is not a decendent of SARS-CoV.
####    Thoughts:
For many times, I have read articles encouraging people to learn coding from side projects. But, I still don't know what to do for a side project. Recently, I happended to read a book teaching people how to write a article. In that book, a sentence touched me, "Don't be afraid of writing bad articles. You have to start writing in order to know how to improve." Although composing articles and writing codes are different, I found the similarity between them - I have to begin to be good.  
Currently, my work is about developing SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests, but I found that I don't know much about SARS-CoV-2. I used to focus on validation of a SARS-CoV-2 qPCR kit and ELISA kit, which is a challenging topic but quite boring. There are written articles about how to perform IVD validation, so the only thing I have to do is understand the article. The challenging part is I need to spend lots of time understanding statistic jargon. It reminds me to brush up my poor statisic knowledge. Besides, if I really want to be good, be innovative in the biotechnology industry, I can't be just satisfied on things that have clear guidelines. I need to learn how to ask good questions and push myself to counqer these questions.
